# form
A single page registration form where javascript is used to check if required fields are filled and if password and password confirmation match. 

If requirements aren't met then an error message will be displayed underneath the relevant input field with a relevant message informing the user of their specific error upon clicking the submit button. If a field is completed successfully then upon clicking the submit button a red check mark will appear above all success input fields.
